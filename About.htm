            Dan Selec had been thinking about his son's future for a long time. Having a child on the autism spectrum, he asked the same question so many parents ask; "What happens when my son grows up? What is out there that can help him today, in a practical and predictable way?" Dan recognized the interest, ability and passion many like his son seemed to display, especially in regard to PC’s and game consoles. If this passion could be harnessed in the form of technical ability, an entirely new method of communication, expression and productivity would be possible.<br />

            The culmination of Dan's thoughts resulted in the foundational nonPareil whitepaper, <a href="files/NPIWP1.pdf">Technical Training for the Autistic Mind</a> written in July 2008.<br /><br />

            Shortly after, Dan met Gary Moore, a parent asking the same questions.  Gary is also the parent of a child on the spectrum, and understood the challenges ahead, and also recognized his son’s similar interest in computers and video games.  It was at this first meeting that Gary committed to helping Dan take his vision and make it a reality, and in September 2008, they founded Nonpareil Institute.<br /><br />

            Dan began training the first student in his kitchen in July 2009, then added a second and third quickly thereafter, due in no small part to the efforts of J’Lynn Anderson who conducted the early student recruiting efforts. The nightly training in Dan’s kitchen  quickly grew to 8 students and five nights a week, for over a year. As his wife says today, “It was just our new norm…”<br />
            
            Gary’s efforts during this time were largely directed at building a network of supporters, partners and donors to help fund the young, fledgling company, as well as finding a location for nonPareils’ first training center.  Through a mutual friend, an introduction was made to the Executive Director of the Guildhall at SMU-in-Plano, which led to a meeting with the Campus Director to consider space for nonPareil.<br /><br />

            The culmination of the efforts of this team resulted in the opening of the first full-time nonPareil operation on the campus of SMU-in-Plano in September 2010. This site, which opened with 8 students, quickly grew to 52 students in the first 8 months. One year later more space was acquired, and the program grew to over 80 students.<br /><br />

            Today, 3 of our original students are full-time employees of the company, with 9 other students being part-time staff.<br />

            As of June 2012, we have 3 apps in the iTunes store, and 1 in the Android store, as well as many free to play maps and campaigns for various popular games. Students have moved from around the country to enroll in this leading edge, ground-breaking, practical solution for adults with autism spectrum disorder which includes technical training, work, and eventually, a residential campus.

                            diagnosed with autism at 18 months of age. At nonPareil, Dan focuses positioning
                            our training, programs, systems and products to build a successful software company
