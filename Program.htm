        <h2>nonPareil</h2>
        <div> - which means ‘no equal’, is the best way to describe our unique and proven program. In a relatively short period of time, we have already seen amazing outcomes with many of our students and employees, and we are quickly becoming positioned to be a world leader in providing practical, life-time solutions to adults with autism spectrum disorder.
        </div>
         <br />
         <h2>Every parent...</h2>
         desires the same future for each of their children as they age into adulthood:
            <ul>
                <li>post-high school education or training which will enable them to secure a career that not only satifies their passion, but also allows them to meet their full potential</li>
                <li>meaningful and fulfilling employment which will provide the financial means to support themselves throughout their lifetime</li>
                <li>to be fully independent, and not dependent on family, friends, the government or others for support</li>
                <li>to be part of a community where they have friends, and have access to those things which enrich their lives and help give meaning, purpose and fulfillment to life</li>
            </ul>
         <br />
         <h2>However,</h2>
         as statistics reveal and experience has demonstrated, those with ASD face a very uncertain future:
            <ul>
                <li>colleges, universities, vocational or job programs are ill-equipped to handle the unique requirements of those with ASD, so admission to or successful completion of a degree or certification eludes most</li>
                <li>similarly, most employers are not prepared to employ those with ASD, as evidenced by the estimated 90% unemployment or under-employment rate; having a college degree or certification does not guarantee employment</li>
                <li>most live with family, and are highly dependent on family or others for support </li>
                <li>as a result, most adults find themselves isolated, lonely, without friends, and generally not part of the community; this can often lead to high anxiety, depression and a general feeling of unfulfillment or a life without purpose</li>
            </ul>

                <li>We add to your knowledge, and with knowledge comes choices. We want to eventually employ every Crew member that grows with us here, but we give them the freedom to decide. A job placed at nonPareil or in the public market is a success either way.</li>
                <li>We are building a company which understands that everyone has their strengths, and is dedicated to helping you find yours; a company which succeeds based on the merit and efforts of our Crew, that recognizes their passion, strengths and abilities, and transforms those abilities into meaningful skills.</li>
                <li>We will provide the necessary skills and job training which focuses on their interests and creative abilities, in an environment that understands their unique challenges and provides the necessary accommodations.</li>
                <li>Each has the opportunity to move from student to employee, for those willing to grow and develop as a contributing member of nP, who dedicate themselves to learning the content, constantly improving their work ethic, work quality and learning the endurance to see a project through to release; the length of time does vary substantially from student to student.</li>
                <li>Employment at nP is based on attaining a certain skill level and work ethic, and being able to contribute to our product teams on a professional level. We want you to be successful, so you can become a functioning member of our team.</li>
                <li>Over time, we will build a campus community where individuals can train, work, live and experience community in an environment specifically suited to meet the needs of our Crew.</li>
                <li>We realize that not all adults with autism will be able to handle the challenges of software design and game or app development. Technology will be the springboard to building our vision, and over time, we plan to create other models of income streams that better suit the unique skills of those more with significant challenges.</li>

            Our training program continues to advance daily. We use various styles and approaches to train our students which allows them to learn at their own pace.  
            We currently offer 29 classes. We provide a NO-pressure environment in which our students can grow and learn.
            Many of our former students have moved into doing production work for public release as staff at nonPareil.
            Our Crew learn about being part of a team. Our Crew learn they don't have to stand alone anymore.
            They now have others to help accomplish their goals. This is central to our philosophy
            of teamwork and community at nonPareil Institute. All for One and One for All.
