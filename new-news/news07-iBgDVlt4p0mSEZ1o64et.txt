nP mentioned by Valve Software!
2012-05-16
At the <a href="http://new.livestream.com/g4c/valve">Games for Change Conference</a> held in New York on June 20th, Valve software mentioned the beta work our Crew participated in for the Portal 2 Puzzle Editor. We worked really hard on this, and most ALL of our Crew took a shot at producing something from this revolutionary tool. This has become part of Valve's Education initiative, and is simply unheard of from an entertainment software company. I cannot tell you how much respect and admiration I have for this company for spending their dollars, and their thought capital, to make something like <a href="http://www.teachwithportals.com/">Teach with Portals</a> happen. The fact that we were able to play a small part is both humbling and gratifying. THANK YOU Valve Team!! Check us out around 18 minutes into the presentation - Dan
