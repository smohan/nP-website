nP. Hosts Our 1st Annual Award Ceremony
2012-04-01
Our first award ceremony was a fantastic evening of seeing just how far our Crew have progressed over the past year. It was a very moving experience for me, looking at our 70+ hard working crew, and thinking back to the day we signed the company into existence back in 2008. I'm so proud of every single individual involved with our organization. It's a privilege to work with all of you. Check out our showcase <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuUuzP6rFAc&amp;feature=plcp">video</a> of some of the great creations our studio has produced! It's going to be a great 2012!
